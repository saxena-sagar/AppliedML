95260,Guanfacine,ADHD,"""My son is halfway through his fourth week of Intuniv. We became concerned when he began this last week, when he started taking the highest dose he will be on. For two days, he could hardly get out of bed, was very cranky, and slept for nearly 8 hours on a drive home from school vacation (very unusual for him.) I called his doctor on Monday morning and she said to stick it out a few days. See how he did at school, and with getting up in the morning. The last two days have been problem free. He is MUCH more agreeable than ever. He is less emotional (a good thing), less cranky. He is remembering all the things he should. Overall his behavior is better. _x000D_
We have tried many different medications and so far this is the most effective.""",8,"April 27, 2010",192,
92703,Lybrel,Birth Control,"""I used to take another oral contraceptive, which had 21 pill cycle, and was very happy- very light periods, max 5 days, no other side effects. But it contained hormone gestodene, which is not available in US, so I switched to Lybrel, because the ingredients are similar. When my other pills ended, I started Lybrel immediately, on my first day of period, as the instructions said. And the period lasted for two weeks. When taking the second pack- same two weeks. And now, with third pack things got even worse- my third period lasted for two weeks and now it&#039;s the end of the third week- I still have daily brown discharge._x000D_
The positive side is that I didn&#039;t have any other side effects. The idea of being period free was so tempting... Alas.""",5,"December 14, 2009",17,
138000,Ortho Evra,Birth Control,"""This is my first time using any form of birth control. I&#039;m glad I went with the patch, I have been on it for 8 months. At first It decreased my libido but that subsided. The only downside is that it made my periods longer (5-6 days to be exact) I used to only have periods for 3-4 days max also made my cramps intense for the first two days of my period, I never had cramps before using birth control. Other than that in happy with the patch""",8,"November 3, 2015",10,
35696,Buprenorphine / naloxone,Opiate Dependence,"""Suboxone has completely turned my life around.  I feel healthier, I&#039;m excelling at my job and I always have money in my pocket and my savings account.  I had none of those before Suboxone and spent years abusing oxycontin.  My paycheck was already spent by the time I got it and I started resorting to scheming and stealing to fund my addiction.  All that is history.  If you&#039;re ready to stop, there&#039;s a good chance that suboxone will put you on the path of great life again.  I have found the side-effects to be minimal compared to oxycontin.  I&#039;m actually sleeping better.   Slight constipation is about it for me.  It truly is amazing. The cost pales in comparison to what I spent on oxycontin.""",9,"November 27, 2016",37,
155963,Cialis,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,"""2nd day on 5mg started to work with rock hard erections however experianced headache, lower bowel preassure. 3rd day erections would wake me up &amp; hurt! Leg/ankles aches   severe lower bowel preassure like you need to go #2 but can&#039;t! Enjoyed the initial rockhard erections but not at these side effects or $230 for months supply! I&#039;m 50 &amp; work out 3Xs a week. Not worth side effects!""",2,"November 28, 2015",43,
165907,Levonorgestrel,Emergency Contraception,"""He pulled out, but he cummed a bit in me. I took the Plan B 26 hours later, and took a pregnancy test two weeks later - - I&#039;m pregnant.""",1,"March 7, 2017",5,
102654,Aripiprazole,Bipolar Disorde,"""Abilify changed my life. There is hope. I was on Zoloft and Clonidine when I first started Abilify at the age of 15.. Zoloft for depression and Clondine to manage my complete rage. My moods were out of control. I was depressed and hopeless one second and then mean, irrational, and full of rage the next. My Dr. prescribed me 2mg of Abilify and from that point on I feel like I have been cured though I know I&#039;m not.. Bi-polar disorder is a constant battle. I know Abilify works for me because I have tried to get off it and lost complete control over my emotions. Went back on it and I was golden again.  I am on 5mg 2x daily. I am now 21 and better than I have ever been in the past. Only side effect is I like to eat a lot.""",10,"March 14, 2015",32,

48928,Ethinyl estradiol / levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I had been on the pill for many years. When my doctor changed my RX to chateal, it was as effective. It really did help me by completely clearing my acne, this takes about 6 months though. I did not gain extra weight, or develop any emotional health issues. I stopped taking it bc I started using a more natural method of birth control, but started to take it bc I hate that my acne came back at age 28. I really hope symptoms like depression, or weight gain do not begin to affect me as I am older now. I&#039;m also naturally moody, so this may worsen things. I was in a negative mental rut today. Also I hope this doesn&#039;t push me over the edge, as I believe I am depressed. Hopefully it&#039;ll be just like when I was younger.""",8,"December 8, 2016",1,
29607,Topiramate,Migraine Prevention,"""I have been on this medication almost two weeks, started out on 25mg and working my way up to 100mg, currently at 50mg. No headaches at all so far and I was having 2-3 crippling migraines a week. I have lost 5.2lbs so far but note I am really paying close attention to what I am eating, I have a lot of weight to lose and if weight loss is a side effect I want to help it along as much as I can.  Now, other side effects, they are there the word recall issues exist, the memory issues, the worst of it seems to be the vision disturbances, there have been times I have just not driven because I&#039;m sure it would not have been safe. The good news is it seems to be wearing off...I have tons of energy and I am in a great mood.""",9,"January 1, 2015",19,
75612,L-methylfolate,Depression,"""I have taken anti-depressants for years, with some improvement but mostly moderate to severe side affects, which makes me go off them._x000D_
_x000D_
I only take Cymbalta now mostly for pain._x000D_
_x000D_
When I began Deplin, I noticed a major improvement overnight. More energy, better disposition, and no sinking to the low lows of major depression. I have been taking it for about 3 months now and feel like a normal person for the first time ever. Best thing, no side effects.""",10,"March 9, 2017",54,
191290,Pentasa,Crohn's Disease,"""I had Crohn&#039;s with a resection 30 years ago and have been mostly in remission since.  Have recently had a bad flare and narrowing at the anastomosis and need to be on medication, but haven&#039;t found one that I can handle.  Asacol gave me such serious body aching and fatigue that I could not function.  Pentasa immediately gave me heart palpitations and arrhythmias so I had to discontinue it.""",4,"July 6, 2013",8,
221320,Dextromethorphan,Cough,"""Have a little bit of a lingering cough from a cold. Not giving me much trouble except keeps me up at night. I heard this was good so I took so I could get some sleep. Helped tremendously with the cough but then I was having bad stomach cramps and diarrhea. I hadn&#039;t eaten anything that should have upset my stomach and it didn&#039;t really feel like a &quot;bug&quot; so I looked up side effects for Delsym.  Now I wish I had done that first because I probably wouldn&#039;t have taken it. So, while it worked for my cough I still didn&#039;t get any sleep due to the stomach issues.""",4,"September 7, 2017",1,
98494,Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""Started Nexplanon 2 months ago because I have a minimal amount of contraception&#039;s I can take due to my inability to take the hormone that is used in most birth controls. I&#039;m trying to give it time because it is one of my only options right now. But honestly if I had options I&#039;d get it removed._x000D_
I&#039;ve never had acne problems in my life, and immediately broke out after getting it implanted. Sex drive is completely gone, and I used to have sex with my boyfriend a few days a week, now its completely forced and not even fun for me anymore. I mean I&#039;m on birth control because I like having sex but don&#039;t want to get pregnant, why take a birth control that takes away sex? Very unhappy and hope that I get it back with time or I&#039;m getting it removed.""",3,"August 7, 2014",10,
81890,Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I have been taking Saxenda since July 2016.  I had severe nausea for about a month once I got up to the 2.6 dosage.  It has since subsided and the only side effect I notice now is the dry mouth.  I make sure to drink  2.5 litres of water a day (about 10 glasses).  This helps with the weight loss as well as the constipation.  I have been reducing my dose to find a comfortable spot where I am still losing weight but don&#039;t feel like I am over medicating.  For me, 1.8 is working very well.  I also feel wearing a Fitbit has really helped.  I can track my food, water, exercise and steps - it keeps me moving more.  When this started I could barely walk the length of myself without getting winded - I have lost 58 lbs so far.""",9,"January 19, 2017",20,
48188,Trimethoprim,Urinary Tract Infection,"""This drug worked very well for me and cleared up my UTI in a matter of 48hrs, although I was on a 7 day course of 2x200mg/daily. Unfortunately once the tablets finished the infection returned so needed a 2nd course. I&#039;m currently taking a low dose at evening to keep the infection at bay while the specialists do some tests.  I normally get every side effect going and dread taking new medication in any form especially after an horrific experience with Ciorofloxacin but the only side effect I experienced with this was itchy ankles and feet on day two but that didn&#039;t last into third day so I would class this as a minor side effect and insignificant. Good luck.""",9,"September 22, 2017",0,
219869,Amitriptyline,ibromyalgia,"""I&#039;ve been taking amitriptyline since January 2013 after being diagnosed with fibromyalgia. I tried cymbalta for a week and my Dr decided that since it kept me awake 24/7 that it wasn&#039;t a good fit for me even though it relieved my pain. I started with 25 mg. After 2 weeks I had some breakthrough pain, so my Dr increased my dosage to 50mg and I&#039;m still on that dosage today. For the first full year I was on this I never had pain and felt &#039;cured&#039;. As time went on, it seems to help control my pain. I do still have pain, but at a low manageable level. I take this around 7pm each evening to avoid feeling overly drowsy in the mornings. This med allows me to have a fairly normal life.""",9,"March 15, 2017",39,
212077,Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve been on every medicine under the sun (it seems) to manage the hypomania / mania of Bipolar2. Within a few days of starting Lamictal (was on Tegretol) it was as if someone had turned a light on in my head. Is this the way &quot;normal&quot; people think? was one of the first things that struck me. I sleep like a log, have no irritability, almost no anger (other than what would be considered normal). I am able to focus and my creative, impulsive thoughts have decreased enough to be manageable. It&#039;s a God send as I would perennially be in a state of hypo mania, which sounds great, but I was physically and emotionally exhausted. My libido is markedly lower but I wonder if that is perhaps an effect of not being hypo manic. I take 20 mg for anxiety.""",10,"November 9, 2014",18,
119705,Nilotinib,Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia,"""I have been on Tasigna for just over 3 years now (300mg x 2 times a day) Tasigna worked for me within a few weeks I have been in remission for basically the entire 3 years. As for the side effects, I feel sick to my stomach, tired,  severe leg and arm pain, I can&#039;t walk to long without needing a break, I went from working full time to not working at all because I am so tired all the time.... but hey I am in remission and alive so is all the above really a problem? Nope""",10,"September 1, 2015",11,
12372,Atripla,HIV Infection,"""Spring of 2008 I was hospitalized with pnuemonia and diagnosed with Lyme diease and full blown AIDS with CD4 count of &quot;11&quot; viral load some number so high in the millions I could never remember. I was taking Combivir and Kaletra with Dapsone for the 1st year then it stopped working. I started Kaletra with the Dapsone my CD4 count is now 209 and rising. For a few weeks I was very aggressive and broke all my dishes in the house LOL. I take vitamin supplements and drink a boost pluz every day. LIfe is good now!""",8,"July 9, 2010",11,
231466,Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I have insomnia, it&#039;s horrible. My story begins with my PCP prescribing me Prozac to help with intestinal issues, because I was desperate I tried it, I was on it for 3 weeks. Stopped because of insomnia. Then I was prescribed Ativan, it out me out, but was very addicting. I had rebound insomnia. Then after about 14 days I hardly any sleep l tried the doctor one more time. I asked him about Trazadone. He told me that was a good medication for insomnia. He put me on 25 mgs, but stated I may have to figure out what dosage is best for me. I am currently taking 100 mgs, which is on the low range of what is prescribed, 400 mgs being at the high end for insomnia. I have the dry mouth and nasel congestion. I can live with that, I sleep now, yeah...""",10,"April 3, 2016",43,
227020,Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""Nexplanon does its job. I can have worry free sex. The only thing is that my periods are sometimes light and sometimes heavy. Sometimes they go away and sometimes they show up unexpected. I also feel somewhat depressed. Not sure if its Nexplanon or not. I&#039;ve had Nexplanont for about 2 months now, but despite the side effects its the most effective birth control I&#039;ve ever used and I do not plan on taking it out.""",9,"August 11, 2014",11,   
41928,Etanercept,Rheumatoid Arthritis,"""I live in Western Australia and disturbed by some comments on here. The cost of Embrel is cost of an ordinary prescription $36 for me the government pays the remainder of the cost to the chemist. I also go to the the medical centre every Saturday morning a Dr looks over my prescription and then he advises the nurse to administer the injection also no cost to myself and this is part of nurses duties. I am unsure of the country where people who have made comments referring to cost and that nobody is there to  administer the injection for them. I am very lucky to live in Australia as we have the best health system worldwide and everybody is  given the opportunity to receive proper medical help whether you are rich or poor there is no discrimination.""",10,"September 16, 2017",4,

51215,Azithromycin,Chlamydia Infection,"""Was prescribed one dose over the course of one day, took 4 pills of 250mg after a light lunch, and had nausea and mild stomach pains/upset. Lying down did not alleviate the discomfort and threw up 3 hours later. Called up my doctor to check if I needed to take another dose but he said my body would have absorbed the pills by then. Still experiencing mild stomach pains but nausea is mostly gone now.""",7,"December 14, 2015",7,
206180,Eflornithine,Hirsutism,"""I&#039;m writing a second review on Vaniqa.  I started using this in February this year. Twice a day although some days/times I do forget. I just want to say how delighted I am to have found this. It has totally and completely changed my life! I had terrible male pattern hair growth all over my cheeks, chin, upper and lower lip and starting to grow down my neck. I used to pluck for up to 2 hrs a time every 3rd day but was never hair free. I wouldn&#039;t kiss anyone hello or goodbye as even plucked the stubble could be felt under my skin. 3 months on im not scared of being caught in bright sunlight I pluck around once a fortnight and it takes around 10 mins. The hairs that are coming through are soft and downy. My life is transformed.""",10,"May 11, 2014",99,
78563,Daytrana,ADHD,"""Hi all, My son who is 12 was diagnosed when he was in 2nd grade. We tried everything before medication. When we tried meds, the first one made him loose weight, fast. The second gave him a nasty tic that thankfully went away as soon as he stopped the med, the third worked for a couple of years and around January of last year we started to have problems so his doctor recommended Daytrana. It has been wonderful for my son! Easy to use, he handles this for himself each day and takes it off when he gets home from school. The patch effects last long enough for him to do his homework. He does have issues with weight gain and sleep but he uses melatonin before bed if he feels like he will not be able to shut down. The shortage is KILLING us!""",10,"January 12, 2017",11,
132258,Ativan,Panic Disorde,"""Honestly, I have been taking ativan for 2 years now 1mg twice daily.  It does help but it should be used as a tool for panic attacks NOT A SOLUTION.  I have tried so many anti-depressants as well such as cymbalta, cipralex and a couple more.  The best thing is to talk to close friends and family or even a psychiatrist.  talking to people and venting is honestly the best thing you can do for yourself even though it takes a lot of will power to do it.  I would love to hear other people opinion.""",6,"June 1, 2015",47,
27339,Imitrex,Migraine,"""At first I suffered through them. This included splitting head pain, nausea, and vomiting. I started using Excedrin after a while which helped if I took it right away. Then that started to not work so well anymore. I had one really bad one that lasted hours. I was still throwing up at 9 pm and I was now throwing up blood. I went to the ER and when I finally got in they put me on an IV to hydrate me. They then added Imitrex to the bag and I soon started feeling side effects. My head felt like I was going to pass out. My breathing became labored and it felt like someone was sitting on my chest. They said that meant it was working. After about two minutes everything was gone. I got pills to take at home and they worked okay. Not as fast.""",8,"October 16, 2012",6,
