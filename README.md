# AppliedML
Problem Statement - This project demonstrates the usage of ML in drug recommendation. The aim of thie project was to form a personalised drug recommendation system. This would be an aid to the doctors for recommending drugs depending on history of the drug usage. This by no means could replace a doctors verdict.

Dataset - The dataset used for the project was taken from UCI repository: 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+Review+Dataset+%28Drugs.com%29#

The dataset required a lot of data-cleaning and preprocessing along with feature engineering, to be used for the problem statement. 

Interesting exploration - NLP was used for feature engineering.

P.S - Due to time constraints the project scope was required to be narrowed down and only a subset of 10 drugs were used to train and test the model.
